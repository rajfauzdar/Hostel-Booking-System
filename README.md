# Hostel-Booking-System
 This system is based on a concept to store all the records of the room’s status and their bookings.
In order to run the project, you must have installed Dev C++ or Code Blocks on your PC.
 The system contains only the admin side. Here, the admin can perform all the tasks like booking rooms, displaying the status of rooms, canceling the booking, and upgrading the booking. There’s no login system for this project.
